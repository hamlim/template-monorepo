# Template monorepo

This is a template repo in GitHub for creating a fresh monorepo for managing code and documentation.

For more details on this setup, refer to my blog post here: https://matthamlin.me/2024/february/library-docs-monorepo-template

## Getting Started:

- Use this template (see `Use this Template` button near the top right corner of the page)
- Clone the newly created repo
- Run `bun install` (if you don't have bun installed locally, refer to their [docs](https://bun.sh))
- Start writing some code!
